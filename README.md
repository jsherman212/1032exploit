I wrote this to learn more about iOS exploitation. It targets iPhone6,2 on iOS 10.3.2 and grants full kernel r/w. It is based off of the same bug v0rtex is based of off (which you're better off using, anyway)

Overall success rate is about 80-85%. If the first reallocation succeeds, success rate from there on out should be 100%.

Below is a list of incredible resources I used while writing this exploit:
